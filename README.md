## Hi there 👋, I am Sebastian

I am a Computer Scientist and C++ Software Developer interested in software development and architecture, testing and cloud related topics.

I have done scientific work (unfinished Phd) at RWTH university and Franhofer Institute of Laser Technologies doing computer vision and some machine learning *(back in the old days, that was before the successful rise of ubiquitious deep learning technology -- support vector machines, anyone?)*

After that I have worked on a company's internal backend product where I also learned tons about CI/CD, testing, doing reviews and all these modern concepts of a sane development process. After an intermediate step at a business intelligence company I'm currently working in the banking sector at Star Finanz GmbH.

I enjoyed earning certificates as ISTQB tester (foundation level and advanced level test automation engineer) and iSAQB software architect (foundation level). The latter really broadened my interest in software development techniques.

Cloud topics and distributed systems are things that keep me interested.
As a consequence, I started learning Golang (twice), my latest attempt is the #100DaysOfCode challenge, following the concept of *learning in public*.

Recently soft aspects of SW development, i.e. the human factor, got my attention.
